function out = mapFeature(X1, X2)
% MAPFEATURE Feature mapping function to polynomial features
%
%   MAPFEATURE(X1, X2) maps the two input features
%   to quadratic features used in the regularization exercise.
%
%   Returns a new feature array with more features, comprising of 
%   X1 that is equa;l to 1, X2, X1.^2, X2.^2, X1*X2, X1*X2.^2, etc..
%
%   Inputs X1, X2 must be the same size
%

degree = 6;
out = ones(size(X1(:,1))); % m vector of 1 also this 1 is x0,
% new columns will be added now which will change stuff
% AWESOME POLYNOMIAL ADDITION
